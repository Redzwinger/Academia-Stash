# College-Dump
Updated: 17/01/2024 (Updated Daily/Weekly)

a dump for all the stuff done during the semesters. 

I'm putting them up here to have manageable copies, instead of random files all over the place, plus it looks good ;)

EDIT (10/01/2024): Now, also maintaining a local Git, using Git integration for Visual Studio. (finally! after years of using VS IDE)
