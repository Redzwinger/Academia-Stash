# College-Dump
[Updated: 27/03/2024]

a dump for all the stuff done during the semesters. 

I'm putting them up here to have manageable copies, instead of random files all over the place, plus it looks good ;)

NOTE (10/01/2024): Now also maintaining a local Git, using Git integration for Visual Studio. (finally! after years of using VS IDE)
